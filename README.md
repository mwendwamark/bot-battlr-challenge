Each bot is represented by a card that displays its name, image, specialty, and catchphrase. To add a bot to your army, simply click the "Add to Army" button on its card. 

Once you have added bots to your army, they will appear in the "Your Bot Army" section on the page. Each bot in your army is represented by a card that displays its name, image, specialty, and catchphrase. To remove a bot from your army, simply click on the card of the bot. 

If you wish to delete a bot from your army entirely/permanently, click the red button with a text of"Remove" its card. This will delete the bot from both the frontend and the backend, and it will no longer be available for selection.
